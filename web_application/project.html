<h2>Project</h2>
The software project is the main assessment component of this course. 
The aim is to develop and then execute a project plan for a
moderately sized software project in teams of 4-5 students <span style="font-weight: bold;">from the same seminar group</span>,
and then implement that plan following the Scrum process. You will need to assign Scrum roles within the project team, but
<span style="font-weight: bold;">all members must take on the developer role</span> and contribute to software develpment.
Students judged by the Lecturer in Charge or seminar facilitator to be insufficiently experienced to undertake the software
project (e.g. who are not in their final year), will be placed in a group of similarly inexperienced students, so as not
to disadvantage other groups.
<p>
The project plan will be developed in the first half of the semester, presented to the seminar group in Week 8 for feedback,
then submitted as a formal document at the end of that week. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You will then be held to that
plan for the remainder of the project</span> (subject to any agreed modifications). The software product will then be demonstrated
in Week 13 (the last week of semester). Thus it is important to develop a realistic and reasonable plan, and then to
<span style="font-weight: bold;">deliver on that plan</span>.
</p><p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">An important part of the project is the appropriate use of project
management tools for planning and executing the project.</span> You need to use a suitable software tool
such as <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/" target="_blank">Pivotal Tracker</a>, though other tools can
be used — provided they support full agile planning and estimation (check with the facilitators before
using any other tool). <span style="font-weight: bold;">You should make use of the tool when planning your
project, and be prepared to show the project plan using the tool during the plan presentation.
</span></p><p>
A list of <em>suggested</em> projects from previous years is given below. However, you are encouraged
to choose your own project, but this must be approved by the lecturers <span style="font-weight: bold;">in
advance of the development of the project plan</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold;">You must ensure
that the project is of a scope suitable for a team project given both the size of the team and the time
available, and suitable for you to demonstrate the required proficiency in software development.</span>
</p><p>
You will be guided by your seminar facilitator, who will also play the
role of the client/customer of your project. <b>Since seminar facilitators
play the role of clients, they cannot provide detailed technical advice
on programming languages or platforms, but will endeavour to do so to
the best of their abilities.</b> In this role, they are to be considered
more as end users who talk primarily to the Product Owner.
The mark for the project plan is a team mark, i.e. all members of the
team receive the same mark, and is based on the presentation of an agile
project plan both in a seminar and in a written document. It is advisable
for the project plan to be entered into the project management tool before
the plan presentation.
</p><p>
The marks for the software product are divided into an individual mark and a team
mark. For the individual mark, you should maintain an <span style="font-weight: bold;">individual diary</span>
that contains your personal record of your daily standup meetings (the entries
should be written answers to the three standard questions: what did I do yesterday?,
what will I do today?, is anything in my way?), plus any planning documents
(such as system designs, user interface mockups). You will need to show this to
your seminar facilitator at regular intervals as this contributes to your individual
mark, and also so that they can assess whether your team project is on track.
In addition, two seminars will be devoted to sprint reviews so that the seminar
group can provide feedback to your team, plus you have the experience of participating
in the audience of a sprint review. Part of your individual assessment is based
on the extent to which you adopt appropriate professional and ethical practices
during the project (e.g. attending meetings, keeping others informed of progress,
etc.) and the use of project management tools. The team mark for the software product
is based on a demonstration held in Week 13, and is partly based on the degree
to which the presented product meets the system proposed in the project plan. Thus
for the software product, while more sophisticated systems generally receive higher marks,
it is critical to meet agreed requirements (i.e. a simpler product of sufficient scope
that performs according to requirements is superior to a more complex product that fails
to meet its requirements). <font color="red"><b>Each member of a team generally receives
the same team mark for the software product, however in "dysfunctional teams" where
member contributions are highly unequal, especially taking account of software development,
individual marks for this component will be adjusted to reflect the level of contribution.</b></font>
</p><p>
Note that as a guide, it is suggested to spend roughly 40-50 hours <span style="font-weight: bold;">per
person</span> on the software project over the semester (this includes all
aspects of the project including planning, development, testing and
demonstration). <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is the responsibility
of the team (at planning time) to ensure (to the best of their knowledge)
that their project can be completed within such a resource allocation.</span>
</p><h3>Project Plan</h3>
The overarching requirement for your project plan is to <span style="font-weight: bold;">demonstrate</span>
that you can deliver a working system, subject to the given timeframe,
budget and resource constraints (here the timeframe and work effort are
fixed, since you have a deadline at the end of semester and you have
4-5 people to do the work). To do this, you will need to take into
account how you are going to develop your system (e.g. initial product
backlog of user stories and tasks, system architecture, etc.).<br>
<br>
Remember that agile software development requires careful planning and estimation
(but of a different kind from a Waterfall plan). Your project plan should contain
some or all of the following (though not necessarily in this order).<br>
<ul>
<li><p>User Stories (assigned to Value Stories or "Epics")
</p></li>
<li><p>Product Backlog (prioritized and including Minimum Viable Product)
</p></li>
<li><p>Estimation of Work for each Product Backlog Item
</p></li>
<li><p>Release Plan (if having multiple releases)
</p></li>
<li><p>Sprint Plan (for initial sprint)
</p></li>
<li><p>Allocation of Roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer)
</p></li>
<li><p>Meeting Schedule (Daily Standup, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective)
</p></li>
<li><p>Relevant Extreme Programming Practices (Pair Programming, Test-Driven Development, etc.)
</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Software Product</h3>
As a team, you will demonstrate your product to the facilitators in the seminar
in Week 13. The team mark for this component will be based on the success of the
project as well as the quality of the product, in particular how well you abided
by your project plan, how you responded to unforeseen events during the
project, etc. In this respect, your presentation should be an honest
evaluation of the outcomes of the project, like a sprint review. Your team
presentation should <span style="font-weight: bold;">not </span>be a "sales pitch":
your audience will play the roles of your managers, who are interested
primarily in outcomes, and software engineers, who may ask detailed questions
about your product's design and implementation. For the quality of the product,
it is important is to produce a working system that meets the objectives and
requirements stated in the project plan, and to be able to justify your design decisions.
There is not necessarily any benefit to be gained by producing software that exceeds
the requirements specified in the agreed plan.

</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><font color="red"><b>There is a disk limit to the cs4920 directory. If your submission is likely to be very large,<br>
please inform the facilitators in advance to avert submission problems for everyone.</b></font></li>
</ul>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<h3>Project Plan</h3>
Marks are allocated based on the following main criteria<br>
<ul>
<li>Completeness of the plan (does it clearly&nbsp;address all relevant aspects as described above?)</li>
<li>Feasibility of the plan (does it look to be a reasonable plan?)</li>
</ul>
It is recognized that planning is difficult and that it is virtually impossible
to produce a "perfect" plan. Thus the benefit of the doubt will be given where
a plan must, by nature of the topic, include uncertainty. The presentation of
the plan will be assessed by the seminar facilitator and by fellow students in
the seminar group.
<h3>Software Product</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Individual mark: determined on a weekly basis (2.5% in each of weeks 9, 10, 11 and 12)
though only finalized at the end of semester, based on adherence to professional and
ethical practices <span style="font-weight: bold;">as recorded in your individual diary,
evidenced by (for example)</span><br>
<ul>
<li>System designs, user interface mockups, etc.</li>
<li>Daily answers to the three standard questions (what did I do yesterday, what will I do today, is anything in my way)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Team mark: determined at the end of semester, based on the quality of the software product
and teamwork practices <span style="font-weight: bold;">as determined from your presentation,
and subject to modification where member contributions, especially to software development,
are highly unequal</span></li>
<ul>
<li>Software quality: Requirements satisfaction, correctness, adherence to design principles</li>
<li>Teamwork practices: Appropriate refinement of scope, stories, tasks, estimations, etc.,
and use of project management tools</li>
</ul>

</ul>
